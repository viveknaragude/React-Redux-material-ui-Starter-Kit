Here's an updated summary with additional improvements:

1. Upgrade to .NET 8: Transitioning from .NET Core 3.0 to .NET 8 significantly improved application performance, thanks to enhanced runtime efficiencies, better memory management, and faster execution times provided by the latest .NET advancements.


2. Replaced Cockpit API with CMHelperStandard in Core-Service: By removing the Cockpit API calls and utilizing the CMHelperStandard package, network latency and dependency issues were minimized, resulting in quicker, more reliable service interactions.


3. Azure Service Profile Integration: Integrating the Azure Service Profile helped identify and fix OutOfMemory exceptions. This proactive profiling enabled better memory usage and stability, preventing critical application failures.


4. Fire-and-Forget API Calls: Implementing fire-and-forget API calls allowed non-critical tasks to execute asynchronously, freeing up resources for primary functions and reducing overall response times.


5. Optimized Async and Await Usage: Employed async and await keywords effectively to handle asynchronous operations without blocking threads. This ensured that tasks were processed concurrently, leading to more efficient resource utilization and faster response times.


6. Optimized LINQ and Collections:

Replaced multiple FirstOrDefault calls with optimized LINQ queries, reducing unnecessary iterations.

Eliminated redundant ToList calls, enhancing memory usage and execution speed.

Leveraged Task and Task.WhenAll for concurrent processing, significantly improving asynchronous task handling and reducing wait times.



7. Enhanced JWT Token and Caching:

Added new user claims directly in the JWT token to reduce multiple backend calls for claims verification.

Retrieved agent profiles from Redis cache instead of database calls, improving response time and offloading the database.



8. Reduced Logging Overhead:

Removed unnecessary logs to reduce clutter and improve log processing speed.

Replaced repetitive Newtonsoft.Json object parsing for logs with optimized methods, reducing CPU and memory usage associated with logging.



9. Stored Procedure Optimization:

Updated stored procedures to remove unnecessary joins, which streamlined queries and reduced query execution time.

Introduced additional WHERE clauses to eliminate duplicate data in GET calls, reducing data retrieval size and improving performance.




These improvements collectively optimized application speed, reliability, resource usage, and logging efficiency, resulting in a more streamlined and effective system.
