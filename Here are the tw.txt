Here are the two separate samples for the Authentication Logic Change and .NET Version Update:


---

Sample 1: Impact Document for Authentication Logic Change

Project Name: User Authentication Service

Date: October 18, 2024

Version: 2.1.0


---

1. Summary of Change

Change Description: Updated the authentication logic to integrate OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, replacing the existing session-based authentication.

Module/Component Affected:

Authentication Service: Major changes in the authentication flow.


Reason for Change: To enhance security, improve scalability, and align with modern authentication standards.


2. Impact on Other Teams

Teams Affected: Frontend/UI Team, User Profile Management Team, API Gateway Team, Logging and Monitoring Team.

Services/UI Affected:

Login endpoints now require OAuth tokens.

Existing authentication mechanisms (e.g., session-based) will be deprecated.


Dependency Areas:

Token Handling: Frontend must handle JWT tokens for secure API access.

Session Management: Session-based features need rework if they depend on authentication.



3. Technical Details

Change Details:

OAuth 2.0 protocol integrated using JWT for token-based authentication.

Refresh tokens added for maintaining user sessions without requiring frequent logins.


Backward Compatibility:

Not backward compatible. The existing session-based authentication will no longer function.


Rollout Plan:

Soft launch in staging environment with feature flags for controlled testing.



4. Testing Requirements

Unit Testing: New unit tests for OAuth token generation, validation, and expiration handling.

Integration Testing: End-to-end testing with frontend and other microservices to validate token-based flows.

Regression Testing: Regression testing needed for all services dependent on user authentication.


5. Risk Assessment

High Impact Areas:

Login flows and token-based API access.

Data privacy/security concerns if not properly tested.


Mitigation Plan:

Comprehensive end-to-end testing with all dependent teams.

Feature flags for gradual rollout.



6. Timeline

Development Completion: October 22, 2024

Internal Testing Complete: October 26, 2024

Expected Completion for Dependent Teams: October 30, 2024

Sample 2: Impact Document for .NET Version Update

Project Name: Core Services Framework

Date: October 18, 2024

Version: 3.0.0


---

1. Summary of Change

Change Description: Upgraded the framework from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6.0 for performance improvements, long-term support, and better security features.

Module/Component Affected:

All microservices that rely on the core framework, including API, service orchestration, and utilities.


Reason for Change:

.NET Core 3.1 is approaching the end of support, and .NET 6.0 offers significant performance and security benefits.



2. Impact on Other Teams

Teams Affected: All teams using the shared services framework, including the Frontend Team, API Gateway Team, and Database Team.

Services/UI Affected:

All services built on .NET Core 3.1 must upgrade to .NET 6.0.


Dependency Areas:

Dependency on NuGet packages and third-party libraries that must also be compatible with .NET 6.0.

CI/CD pipeline updates required to support the new .NET version.



3. Technical Details

Change Details:

Migrated from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6.0.

Updated all dependencies to versions compatible with .NET 6.0.

Changes in garbage collection, performance optimizations, and API updates in the new version.


Backward Compatibility:

Limited backward compatibility. Any microservices still on .NET Core 3.1 must upgrade.


Rollout Plan:

All services will be tested in staging before production deployment.



4. Testing Requirements

Unit Testing: Ensure all unit tests are compatible with the .NET 6.0 environment.

Integration Testing: Integration tests must be executed with dependent services to verify compatibility.

Regression Testing: Regression testing for all core functionalities and external service integrations.


5. Risk Assessment

High Impact Areas:

Service compatibility and potential issues with outdated NuGet packages or third-party libraries.


Mitigation Plan:

Thorough testing in staging and sandbox environments with all dependent services.



6. Timeline

Development Completion: October 20, 2024

Internal Testing Complete: October 24, 2024

Expected Completion for Dependent Teams: October 28, 2024
